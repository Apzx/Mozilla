This is a working version of a WebRTC test tool. It currently only works in Nightly

To run it, either go to rtctest.lolnet.org, or run server.js and acess it from localhost:8080

There needs to be a /bot_side.html page running for the test to finish. (If you are using the online version, there may be a bot already running)

The user interface of the test is located at /user_side.html

There is a functionnal test located at /test/mocha.localTest.html (Unavailable on the online version)
